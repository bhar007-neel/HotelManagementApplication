DAO Pattern: Clean separation of data access logic using DAO classes (HotelDAO, RoomDAO, etc.).

Modular Architecture: Follows MVC-like separation for maintainability.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple web UI using JSP and servlets to navigate and manage records.

Authentication-based Access: Only authenticated admins can manage hotel and employee records.

💡 What I Learned:
Connecting Java web apps to a PostgreSQL database using JDBC.

Implementing real-world features like search and filter within CRUD forms.

Structuring backend logic with the DAO pattern.

Building dynamic web pages with JSP and routing with Servlets.

Debugging Tomcat deployment and handling exceptions gracefully.
